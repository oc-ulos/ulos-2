# performance while doing file I/O in small chunks.  Ideally this is
# identical to the managed filesystem's maximum read chunk size (if
# you're not sure what it's set to, check your OpenComputers configuration).
# 1024 seems like a fair tradeoff between memory and speed, so it's the
# default.  If performance is lacking and you think your code is IO-bound,
# you can try increasing this number.  If you're running into out-of-memory
