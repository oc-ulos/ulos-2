# Contributing to ULOS 2

This document outlines some basic guidelines that ULOS 2 contributors should follow.

All code should be indented with 2 spaces (**not** tabs), have a reasonable amount of whitespace for readability, and be reasonably well-documented.  Libraries should be documented using [LDoc](https://stevedonovan.github.io/ldoc/manual/doc.md.html).

Some features may be better as separate packages.  These will either be integrated into the main repository as submodules _or_ relegated to other repositories as the core developers (mostly Ocawesome101) see fit.
